 Editing video or audio often felt complex and intimidating—for both new users and the Express ecosystem. Quick Actions was created to bridge that gap: a set of streamlined, single-task workflows that made editing approachable and fast. By surfacing Express’ core video capabilities in a lightweight, focused way, users could experiment, learn, and achieve quick wins without diving into a full editor.
This initiative not only helped users discover the depth of Express but also offered a pathway to conversion, turning quick edits into long-term engagement.
 <br/>
 Video/audio editing posed problems for both users and Express’ end.

        I led the Video Quick Actions workflow & framework designs. I worked with 2 Product Managers, and two Engineering Teams spread across two geographies. I also worked in parallel to the Image Quick Action design team to define the overall Quick Action framework.
        <br/>
        I worked on Video Quick Actions for 2 years where we updated the framework twice, reworked on the workflows multiple times to constantly make the experience efficient and thereby quick with each iteration. I was responsible for creating individual quick actions which let users edit quickly to gathering feedback to defining the experience in the editor.

    Quick actions are lightweight, purpose driven editing workflows that allow users to perform focused creative tasks like removing a background, trimming a video, resizing aspect ratio, or merging clips, etc. in just a few clicks. They’re designed as standalone, zero-friction entry points into Express that don’t require sign-in, offering instant value and enabling users to experience the power of Adobe’s creative tools without commitment.
    <br/>
    Quick Actions embody the principle of “progressive engagement” that lets users start small, succeed quickly, and naturally deepen their usage over time.
